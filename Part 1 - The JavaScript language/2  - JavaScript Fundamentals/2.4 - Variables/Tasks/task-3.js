/* Uppercase const?

Examine the following code:

const birthday = '18.04.1982';
const age = someCode(birthday);

Here we have a constant birthday date and the age is calculated from birthday with the help of some code (it is not provided for shortness, and because details donâ€™t matter here).

Would it be right to use upper case for birthday? For age? Or even for both?

const BIRTHDAY = '18.04.1982'; // make uppercase?
const AGE = someCode(BIRTHDAY); // make uppercase? */

const BIRTHDAY = '09.01.1985'
const age = getAge(BIRTHDAY)

function getAge(birthday) {
    const todayDate = new Date()
    const birthdayDate = new Date(birthday.slice(6, 4), birthday.slice(4, 2), birthday.slice(0, 2))

    return 
}
