/* Specification

The ECMA-262 specification contains the most in-depth, detailed and formalized information about 
JavaScript. It defines the language.

But being that formalized, it’s difficult to understand at first. So if you need the most trustworthy 
source of information about the language details, the specification is the right place. But it’s not 
for everyday use.

A new specification version is released every year. In-between these releases, the latest specification 
draft is at https://tc39.es/ecma262/.

To read about new bleeding-edge features, including those that are “almost standard” (so-called 
“stage 3”), see proposals at https://github.com/tc39/proposals.

Also, if you’re in developing for the browser, then there are other specs covered in the second part 
of the tutorial.
