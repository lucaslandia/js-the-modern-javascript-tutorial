/* Developer console

But in the browser, users don’t see errors by default. So, if something goes wrong in the script, 
we won’t see what’s broken and can’t fix it.

To see errors and get a lot of other useful information about scripts, “developer tools” have been
embedded in browsers.

Most developers lean towards Chrome or Firefox for development because those browsers have the best 
developer tools. Other browsers also provide developer tools, sometimes with special features, but 
are usually playing “catch-up” to Chrome or Firefox. So most developers have a “favorite” browser 
and switch to others if a problem is browser-specific. */
